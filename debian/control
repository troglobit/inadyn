Description: Simple and small DynDNS client with HTTPS support
 Inadyn is a small and simple DDNS client with HTTPS support.
 It is commonly available in many GNU/Linux distributions, used
 in off-the-shelf routers and Internet gateways to automate the task of
 keeping your DNS record up to date with any IP address changes from your
 ISP. It can also be used in installations with redundant (backup)
 connections to the Internet.
 .
 Inadyn can maintain multiple host names with the same IP address, and
 has a web based IP detection which runs well behind a NAT router.
 .
 The following DDNS providers are supported natively, other providers,
 like http://twoDNS.de for instance, can be supported using the generic
 DDNS plugin.
