Description: client to alleviate the requirements for an Internet name
 With this package the user can have an Internet name for his host 
 even though he might not have a name server or a static IP. It works
 by being a client of a supposedly open name server and updating the 
 server's records when the need arise. A partial list of the servers
 that are supported is http://{www.dyndns.org,freedns.afraid.org,
 www.zoneedit.com,www.no-ip.com}. Some of the services of these servers
 are free of charge.
 This is a command line tool that is written in portable ANSI C with a 
 little OS abstraction layer. It can maintain multiple host names with
 the same IP address, and has a web based IP detection which runs well
 behind a NAT router.
