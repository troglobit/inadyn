       - If the Dynamic DNS server responds with an error Inadyn will abort.
         This will prevent further retries with wrong dyndns credentials.
       - Default port number included in the request, to support the requests
         via Proxy, to ports different than 80.
       - Simplified main inadyn update loop function. (there was no bug there)

          server

Ver. 1.90  - 24 February  2005
    - New features/enhancements:

          user after launch. Typical feature for daemons.

          parameter: the URL to read from the given server name.

        - a more **NIX like format for the config file. 
          Thanks to Jerome Benoit. 
 
    - Small bugfix:
        - in case when 'iterations' option is specified as being '1',
          inadyn exits immediately after first update, not after the
          sleep period as before.
