.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ,
or In-a-Dyn, periodically checks your actual Internet accessible IP for
changes.  When it changes
.Nm
updates your name server record(s) automatically.
.Pp
Common DDNS service providers supported by
.Nm
are listed below.  Some of these services are free of charge for
non-commercial use, others take a small fee, but also provide more
domain names to choose from.

.Pp
DDNS providers not listed here, like
.Aq http://twoDNS.de ,
can often be configured using the generic DDNS provider plugin.  See
.Xr inadyn.conf 5
for example configurations.
.Sh OPTIONS
Earlier versions of
.Nm
supported more command line options, from v2.0
.Nm
has been greatly simplified.  See
.Xr inadyn.conf 5
for defails of the
.Pa /etc/inadyn.conf
configuration file format.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 1, -once
Force one update and quit
.It Fl c, -continue-on-error
Ignore errors from DDNS provider and try again later.  This command line
option tells
.Nm
to not exit on errors from a DDNS provider and instead try again later.
Please do not use this, it usually indicates that we are sending a
malformed request, e.g. wrong username, password or DNS alias for the
given account.  Continuing could possibly lock you out of your account!
.It Fl e, -exec=/path/to/cmd
Full path to command, or script, to run after a successful DDNS update.
The following environment variables are set: INADYN_IP, INADYN_HOSTNAME.
The first environment variable contains the new IP address, the second
the host name alias.  The
.Nm cmd
is called for each listed host name that is successfully updated.  If
.Nm
is started with the
.Fl i Ar IFNAME
command line option, the INADYN_IFACE environment variable is also
set.
.It Fl f, -config Ar FILE
Use
.Ar FILE
for configuration. By default
.Pa /etc/inadyn.conf ,
is used.  See
.Xr inadyn.conf 5
for examples.
.It Fl h, -help
Show summary of command line options and exit
.It Fl i, -iface Ar IFNAME
Check IP of IFNAME instead of querying an external server.  With this
command line option the external IP check is disabled and
.Nm
will report the IP address of
.Ar IFNAME
to the DDNS providers listed in the configuration file.  This can be
very useful to set register LAN IP addresses, or to speed up the IP
check if the DDNS provider's check-ip servers are slow to respond.
.It Fl l, -loglevel Ar LEVEL
Set log level: none, err, info,
.Ar notice ,
debug
.It Fl n, -forground
Run in foreground, default is to daemonize and background.
.It Fl -pidfile Ar NAME
Override basename of default PID file.  Useful if running multiple
instances of
.Nm .
With this option you can change the base name of the PID file, not the
location, which is system specific.  Usually
.Pa /var/run/inadyn.pid ,
or
.Pa /run/inadyn.pid .
.It Fl p, -drop-privs=USER Ns Op : Ns Ar GROUP
Drop root privileges after initial setup to the given user and group.
.It Fl s, -syslog
Use
.Xr syslog 3
for log messages, warnings and error conditions.  This is the default
when running in the background.  When running in the foreground, see
.Fl n ,
log messages are printed to stdout.
.It Fl t, -startup-delay Ar SEC
Initial startup delay.  Default is 0 seconds.  Any signal can be used to
abort the startup delay early, but SIGUSR2 is the recommended to use.
See
.Sx SIGNALS
below for full details of how
.Nm
responds to signals.
.Pp
Intended to allow time for embedded devices without a battery backed
real time clock to set their clock via NTP at bootup.  This is so that
the time since the last update can be calculated correctly from the
.Nm
cache file and the
.Cm forced-update=SEC
setting honored across reboots, avoiding unnecessary IP address updates.
.It Fl v, -version
Show program version and exit.
.El
.Sh OUTPUT
.Nm
prints a message when the IP is updated.  If no update is needed then by
default it prints a single
.Dq .\&
character, unless
.Fl -loglevel
is set to
.Ar none .
Therefore, unless
.Fl -loglevel
is set to
.Ar none ,
the log will contain lots of dots.  When the connection goes down
.Nm
may print some harmless error messages which should be followed by
.Dq OK
messages after the Internet connection is restored.
.Sh SIGNALS
.Nm
responds to the following signals:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width TERM -compact
.It HUP
Reload the
.Nm .conf 
file, standard UNIX behavior
.It TERM
Tell
.Nm
to exit gracefully
.It INT
Same as TERM
.It USR1
Force update now, even if the IP address has not changed.  Works in
tandem with
.Fl -fake-address
.It USR2
Check IP address change now. Useful when a new DHCP/PPPoE lease or new
gateway is received.  Please note that
.Nm
does not track such events by itself.  You need an external monitor for
that
.El
.Pp
For convenience in sending signals,
.Nm
writes its process ID to
.Pa /var/run/inadyn.pid
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/cache/inadyn/freedns.afraid.org.cache -compact
.It Pa /etc/inadyn.conf
.It Pa /var/run/inadyn.pid
.It Pa /var/cache/inadyn/dyndns.org.cache
.It Pa /var/cache/inadyn/freedns.afraid.org.cache
.It Pa ... one .cache file per DDNS provider
